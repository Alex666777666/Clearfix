        The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of
        its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The
        element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still
        remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning). As
        mentioned above, when an element is floated, it is taken out of the
        normal flow of the document (though still remaining part of it). It is
        shifted to the left, or right, until it touches the edge of its
        containing box, or another floated element. In this example, there are
        three colored squares. Two are floated left, and one is floated right.
        Note that the second "left" square is placed to the right of the first.
        Additional squares would continue to stack to the right, until they
        filled the containing box, after which they would wrap to the next line.
